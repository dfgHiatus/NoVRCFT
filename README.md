# NoVRCFT
Screen mode eye and face tracking for VRChat. This will work with avatars already setup for VRCFT.

Based of the [NeosWCFaceTrack](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/NeosWCFaceTrack "NeosWCFaceTrack") app and [OpenSeeFace](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace "OpenSeeFace").

# Installation
1. Download the most recent copy of NoVRCFT from the releases tab and extract it.
2. Place the ```WCFace.dll``` file inside your ```...\AppData\Roaming\VRCFaceTracking\CustomLibs``` folder. You can get here by pressing ```Windows+R``` and typing in  ```%appdata```. You can create the folder if it\'s missing.
3. Run WCFace by clicking on ```WCFace - Shortcut```. Now, run the bundled ```VRCFaceTracking - Shortcut```.
4. Start VRChat.
5. Go crazy! You can use the Debug OSC Dialouge to see if everything is working properly.
