# NoVRCFT
Screen mode eye and face tracking for VRChat. This will work with avatars already setup for VRCFT.

Based of the [NeosWCFaceTrack](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/NeosWCFaceTrack "NeosWCFaceTrack") app and [OpenSeeFace](https://github.com/emilianavt/OpenSeeFace "OpenSeeFace").

# Installation

2. Place the ```WCFace.dll``` file inside your ```...\AppData\Roaming\VRCFaceTracking\CustomLibs``` folder. You can get here by pressing ```Windows+R``` and typing in  ```%appdata```. You can create the folder if it\'s missing.
3. Head over to [here](https://github.com/Ruz-eh/NeosWCFaceTrack/releases/tag/1.0.2 "here") and put this somewhere safe. Inside of this, head to ```\Binaries``` and make a shortcut to ```run.bat```. Place this on your desktop!
4. Run WCFace by clicking on your new ```run.bat```. Now, run the bundled ```VRCFaceTracking.exe```.
